# fetch_demo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is the fetch coding exercise, It's completely written in dart and flutter. To run this code, just install the dart sdk from flutter official website and clone this repository to your android studio. You are all set then run on your emulator or the real device. I've also added the apk file for this app, so you can run it directly.
